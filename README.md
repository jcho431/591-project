# 591-project

We will use python plus a package that we installed so that we can run Macaulay2 alongside jupyter notebook. 

1. First we need to install Macaulay2 onto our computer, and instructions can be found on the Macaulay2 website.

2. Next install the Macaulay2 kernel for Jupyter notebook from this website
https://pypi.org/project/macaulay2-jupyter-kernel/

3. Since Jupyter notebook can only run one kernel at a time by default,
we need to install the SoS package to run both the Python kernel and Macaulay2 kernel at the same time.
